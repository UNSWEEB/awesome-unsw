# COMP1531 Software Engineering Fundamentals

> This course is teaches students about software engineering principles via exposure to the important practice of building correct products in effectively functioning teams.
> The students are exposed to agile software practices, team collaboration and effective communication through implementing a group project based on agile software methodologies that requires them to analyse, design, build and deploy a web-based application. This course is typically taken in the semester after completing COMP 1511, but could be delayed and taken later. It provides essential background for the teamwork and project management required in many later courses.
The goal of this course is to expose the students to:

* Demonstrating effective use of the python programming language
* Basic elements of software engineering - derived from the life-cycle of a software system, including requirements elicitation, analysis and specification; design; construction; verification and validation; deployment;
* Software engineering methodologies, processes, tools and techniques
* Agile software, collaboration and communication practices
* Web-based system architecture and development practices on web platforms
